  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!
* I have learnt a bunch of new skills. The strike-through, superscript and horizontal rule tags amongst others.
* TBH, all has been easy. :)
* None
* This is a stepping stone for me. I won't say I have encountered any challenges yet. I'm looking forward to a more complicated challenge. :)
